Today I saw an interesting reply attached to the following link. Here vanhees71 who wrote this reply expressed something very interesting and I thought I can add my comments which may sound surprising. So I left few comments here.


vanhees71 replied,
> As far as I know, originally Schrödinger thought that particles are just described as fields and that his wave function for the electron is just describing a spreaded charge distribution $\rho(t,\vec{x})=|\psi(t,\vec{x})|^2$, but that was very soon be verified to be wrong since detecting an electron always leaves one spot on a photon plate (or any other kind of detector), and this finally brought Born to his probability interpretation, i.e., the wave function should be normalized to 1, and then gives the probability distribution of the position of the electron as a function of time.


He pointed 3 things in his reply
1. Schrödinger's original idea on how to interpret wave function for the electron is a spreaded chard distribution. - **Interpretation**
2. Detecting an electron always leaves one spot. - **Fact**
3. Born's interpretation: the probability distribution of the position of the electron as a function of time. - **interpretation**

I think vanhees71 seems to believe 3 points above are different things and not same. To spoil my conclusion in advance, I think these 3 points looking incompatible and impossible to coexist in one single framework can be unified under single proper framework. In my view, there are looking different but I strongly believe that two interpretations from Schrödinger and Born are both correct and can be seen the exact same thing if one is given a proper logical framework which I will describe soon.
To understand my logic, it is crucial to understand properly and precisely what the role of time plays in particle's motion. To make readers better understanding the reality of time, I think readers must be familiar to Ontological view saying that true reality of thing does not change by anything external so absolute and what observer feels about the thing is illusory so relativistic. I strongly argue readers must believe this ontological view applies to time too. This is the first key point. Again, this view will free reader from current hazard built upon two great principles in modern physics and move forward next physics. Bear with me until my story end. I promise you will be rewarded for your patience.

Will be added later soon.

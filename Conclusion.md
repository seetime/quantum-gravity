## Note:
This part is the ultimate message I want to share with readers who want to know what gravity is. It is the relation between the most fundamental constitutents of our universe: space, time, energy and mass. All my posts here are and will be presented for this purpose. I write the conclusion in advance before providing all details hoping this conclusion will help reader to understand what the context are in my detailed explanations which will be provided soon. The following conclusion is presented to provide reader how to interprete my idea to understand better on the nature of gravity.


# Conclusion
The distance in our familar 3 dimensional space is absolute. I hope readers forget about Einstein's Relativity for a while and accept the notion of absolute distance in space. Later I will explain what is missing part in Einstein's relativity. Each axis, x,y,z has no ends and origin in principle. Each axis is continuous not granular.

Energy is an object localized in this absolute space which means it occupy a single point in space always. Energy can move in this empty space. When energy moves in space, it must pay something which we normally call it time. Suppose there are two absolute points, **a** and **b** along x axis in space and an energy object **E** is localized at **a** initially. If **E** is to travel from **a** to **b**, it must pay the traveling fee as in a form of time. The analogy is the traveling cities. If one want to travel from Seoul to NewYork, he need to pay transfortation fee with his money. It can be few thousend dollars by buying air plane ticket or few money if he want to sail with his own boat if possible.

The same thing happens to Energy object. The cost need to be paid for an energy object **E** to travel can be varied from zero to infinity. Zero cost means the enegy **E** does not experience time flow when traveling along two seprate points. Infinite cost means **E** require infinite time for traveling or it never moves and staying at **a** forever. If **E** need zero cost for traveling, we usually call it light. If **E** need infinite cost for traveling, it has a name familar to us, (pure) mass. If the cost is a scalar value between zero and infinity, then the object will experience time flow like us human, earth, sun, stars and all movable matters.

As can be seen in Einstein's famous equation $E=mc^2$, Energy and mass can be interchaneable. But it will remove ambiguity about the term energy by dividing into two types. From now, I will call the energy of photon is *penergy* and the energy of mass is *menergy*. By using this notion, normal matters including electron, lepton, atom, gold, human and so on can be thought as the linear sum of *penergy* and *menergy*. So total energy $E_t$ can be expressed as follows

$$E_t=pE_p+qE_m$$ where p, q are natural numbers.

It is my proposal that the cost time that a matter need to pay for traveling distance can be determined by p and q as follows and I think it can be testable arguement. It is much similar to the time dialation equation.

$$dT= T^0\left({\frac 1{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{q^2}{(p+q)^2}\right)}}}-1\right)$$, where $dT$ is unit time what a moving object need to pay for traveling over unit distance.


In my notation, *penergy* can be expressed as
$$E_p=e^{Ni}$$ where N is integer.

*menergy* can be expressed as
$$E_p=e^{N0}$$ where N is integer and 0 is a symbol indicating the sum of the positive penergy and negative penergy telling $0=i+(-i)$. From this notation, readers can easily understand why $c$ is squared in Einstein's equation $E=mc^2$ because the numberic value for mass is always even numbered. To help better understanding the analogy would be that a pure mass object can be thought as not rotating object by merging two objects spinning opposite direction so rotation canceled out.

It would be worthy to note that, in this notion, the linear sum is expressed as multiplication as follows.

$$e^{pi}e^{q0}=e^{pi}e^{q(i+(-i))}$$

This is the core idea to understand gravity.

# quantum-gravity
This project is made to share what I learned about so-called quantum gravity which will make the unification of Quantum mechanics and General relativity since I was first interested in this subject in 2014. In fact, I didn't think that the first study about the behavior of trajectory of Lorenz Attractor and later hidden symmetry in never-ending not-repeated digits for the one of famout irrational number $\pi$ will guide to understand the most fundamental nature of our space and time which will be the main topic in the study.

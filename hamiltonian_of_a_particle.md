# Next generation principle in Physics

This part contains what I propose for the early form of Quantum gravity or theory of everything. All other materials included in this repo are just supplementary for this part. Let me first introduce this part and will provide detailed explanations later.


In my humble opinion, Physics is all about understanding the changes in spatial dimension of either a particle like photon, electron or a everything we can see such as ball, car, earth, sun, galaxy and so on. I am sure that every all physicists who know Quantum Mechanics wont accept my above opinion because it is major belief that it is impossible to decide the motion in space and time in subatomic scale. Yes, I too agree on that impossibility of measuring the exact motion trajectory in space and time but the difference between me and majority is that I have a different view on why we human as massive observer cannot measure the exact trajectory of a subatomic scale particle. Instead of Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle for the reason, I argue it is due to time nature which I will explain later. Yes, it is time magic which cause all weird behaviors in quantum world and gravity itself. To explain my theory, let me introduce first on the three basic elements in our universe: 1) space, 2) time and 3) energy.


## Three basic elements consisting of our universe.

First assumption is that our universe is consisted of three basic elements: Space, time and energy. The play can be thought as analogy to this. The stage is like space and energy is like actor/actress or object which can be localized in the stage. Time can be thought as what enables the position change of energy in Physics or actor/actress in play. The important thing here is the energy can exist only in localized form in a bounded area in space. What the meaning of the localized energy form is will be clearer as the discussion continue.


The second assumption is that energy

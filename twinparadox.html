    <h1>How Twin paradox can be understood</h1>

    <p>
        At initial tick=0, two particles are seperated from each other by 300 and move positive x direction while keeping their distance unchanged. In this period, they are in stationary motion.
        Then at tick=100, lower particle 1 then enter into energy field acting like a force field so adding more boosted energy to particle 1 so accelerated.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a particle, if total energy is \(tE = (p + q)E\), the ratio (similar to Lorentz factor) can be calculated as follows:
        $$ratio = { 1 \over { \sqrt{1 - {p^2 \over (p+q)^2}}}} - 1$$

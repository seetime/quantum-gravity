# Introduction

What I am telling now is a new idea you never heard of. It is the result of my sole studies for last few years to understand a simple question: Does subatomic particle feel the space and time as we human feel space and time? Can we human know the exact motion of the elementary particle in space and time? I know Quantum mechanics says it is impossible for us to know the position and momentum of it at the same time due to Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle. Although I didn't majored any regular physics course in university, I have been curious on Physics especially in the all weird phenomena mentioned in Quantum mechanics and General relativity and made some satisfactory outcome with help of many YouTube videos and online materials accessible easily to me. Without many other's kind contributions uploaded freely on web, it would be impossible to write any small piece on this topic. So I think it would be square my debt to open my findings and it is one main reason why I write this paper.


I would like to introduce my conclusion first. Later, there will be a chance to introduce why I get to this conclusion and what obstacles I need to overcome in another post in detail.


# Hamiltonian of a elementary particle.

Simple is the best could be a just belief but strong guidance to direct us to right path. I found a much simpler Hamiltonian expression about the state of elementary particle. In my theory, all fundamental building blocks in our universe is believed to share one single common form which is called *energy*. The Standard model of particle physics list many elementary particles push three fundamental forces but in my view they are treated as just variants of one common form: energy. Again, this writing is about new revolutionary idea on how we can interpret universe.


In my physical model, every particle including photon, electron, quarks is associated with an energy value defined in complex number domain. It was hinted by the wave-particle duality which is the basic property of every observable object. It is 2d complex domain. I chose the horizontal axis is for mass term of the Energy and the vertical axis for wave term. As the vertical axis in 2d complex domain is the imaginary part, the wave axis also is accompanied by imaginary number *i*. For example, a photon's energy is only dependent on its frequency which is the property of wave, expressed as  $E_w=ih\nu$. I am sure readers will laugh at me if I say the wave energy of photon is not real number but imaginary number but bear with me for a while. I am sure readers will accept my view in the end.

On the other hand, the mass term will be positioned in real axis in 2d complex domain. Einstein's famous equation $E_m=mc^2$ says mass is equivalent to energy. In natural unit, massless photon's energy is equal to its frequency and the energy of pure mass object is equal to its mass value. To sum up my explanation, every pure wave and mass particle can be depicted as a point on imaginary axis for photon and real axis for pure mass particle as in picture 1.

# Basic assumptions

It is well known to most physicists that our current understanding about time, space, energy and mass, the most fundamental elements consisting of our universe, is far from completion.
In order to explain my new idea which will show a way to solve the problem of time and space
What I try to do here is to explain intuitively the motion of an elementary particle which can be observed in space and time dimension rather than strict mathematical formulation. It means this assumptions part is mostly based on some philosophical views which were known since ancient Greek 2500 years ago. The most two influential philosophical views that helped me a lot in studying this subject are **Parmenides's ontology** and **Pythagoras's "everything is number"**. Whenever I stuck on any weirdness in every abstracted notions such as infinity, massless and timeless which could not be easily understood, they showed me guiding principles and exit. You will see this occasionally in following discussion at the most fundamental level where nothing remains to be referred to. One more thing to note is a personal preference to simpler thing. I will choose a simpler one if there are two options producing exactly same predictions I can take. Simply, my new gravity model is better than Einstein's GR because it is simpler than it and provide much more deep insights on the most fundamental concepts such as infinity, time, energy and so on.

## Prerequisites

It is logically natural to think that there is no way to create something existent from nothing. So it is the first belief that there must be something exist before discussing about our entire universe.

The minimal requirement for describing our universe is assumed to be the existence of three components: space, time and energy. **In my assumption, first two components, space and time are both environmental dimension and the last component, energy (particle) is the only active component which can be positioned only at a single point in the realm of the first two environmental dimensions, space and time.**. That is all. Nothing else is required to build or describe fully our universe, at least in my model. It will be the most simplest model, isn't it?

The last sentence in bold is actually too simple to deliver what I have in mind correctly and impose too many things untold. To do so, it must be followed by detailed explanations on each of them and they are all basically assumptions or hypothesis.


## Three basic constituents of universe

1. Space
2. Time
3. Energy



## Space

Space is simply emptiness or void which can be thought as a boundless room for the only localizable and movable component out of three component to be placed. So it is a kind of environmental or background dimension because it has neither beginning nor end and it is just single entity which cannot be divided or separable into subsets. It is crucial in my view that space itself is fixed in our universe and does not change its shape by any other external entity.

This new idea seems to violate the most common belief established by Einstein's theory of General Relativity that space-time is curved by existence of mass. Although GR enables us to understand almost every motion of object in macroscopic scale universe such as car, earth and galaxy, it has still problem to describe motions of elementary particles in microscopic world up to Planck scale such as electron, photon and etc. So I argue that revival for absolute time and space but additional some assumptions which will be introduced in this series of articles will show a way to solve the problem built in GR.

In our universe it is believed that space has three dimensions which is three different reference lines named as x, y and z in Cartesian coordinate system. They all shares same characteristics except their directions perpendicular to each other. So helping user to understand my new assumptions and for simplicity, I will talk about single reference line only for now.


The assumptions include that modificationsovercome the hurdle But what I am trying to explain here is not trying to disprove Einstein's holy theory. It's quite the opposite.

<del>If we agree on Pythagorean philosophy saying everything is number, then we can think of an exact 1:1 mapping between 1 spatial dimension, i.e x axis in 3 spacial dimension and real number. With such view, we can label every points of the 1 spatial dimension with numbers without missing just single one.

<del>Space, as a single indivisible entity, is a common resource to every energy components. Empty space is absolutely necessary for the existence of energy component. It provides room where something, i.e. energy, is located at. Every separate energy components can coexist together in it. Every energy component must live with this space without exception. Space provide a method for us to distinguish two seperate point-like particles which is away from each other with non-zero distance.

<del>So far I wrote about very boring story and reader may accept my previous description without further arguement. But it is time to introduce something weird view point. First new point of view I want to introduce is that the notion of distance which is measurement of how long two seperate positions are seperate from each other in space or length of any rigid body is emergent property to observer in the same space. Special relativity theory tells us there is a phenomena called space dialation depending on the status of observer. It is a fact but, in my new theory, it is just illusion. I would say that it is true there happens *illusory* space/time dialation but I will show in this paper that the length of rigid body A standing still in a inertial reference frame is exactly same with the length of the same rigid body B moving relative to A. Space and time dialation is only measurable to observer and not observed in the inertial reference frame of light. Be stay tuned.

<del>It is infinitely long which means there are infinitely many points where point-like particle, i.e energy, can be located at. The most important thing to be noted is it is equally same with that comparing the size of parts of it is meaningless or it is impossible to define the size of any subset fo background dimension if there is no engagement of external measure. Its only role is just a container which provides rooms for point-like particle. Space provides spatial room and time provides temporal room to point-like particle.

<del> are independent with the existence of third component, energy. In other word, space does not change itself container dimensions where energy can be localized in. Energy is assumed to be a point like particle which is confined within a finite region of space and time. It means that energy does not take multiple places in space and time. Energy as a particle is assumed to take only one point along endless space. The probability distribution of a subatomic particle which is believed true in quantum mechanics is a derivable property in my new model which will be explained later.

<del>Similar analogy about the relation between three components would be a play as a universe. In play, there are three basic components: stage as space, time as time and actor/item as energy. Actor/items can be placed on a finite region of stage. Surely actor cannot exist on multiple places. Play has a beginning and end which corresponds to time. Time plays a common role responsible for describing changes in stage and space. Time can be used to order timely the spatial change of actor or energy. So our entire universe is assumed to be completed with the infinitely many possible combinations of these thee components: space, time and energy.</del>

## Time




## Energy

It is assumed to be a point like particle which exists at a single point in two different types of dimensions: *Space* and *Time*. It is also assumed that, by being born in space and time although it is unknown what how are created all three basic ingredients - *Space*, *Time* and *Energy*, every energy particle without exception is ruled by the nature law of space and time which the ratio of unit length of *Space* and *Time* is constant. The nature law can be written down as below and I will call it **Space-time law**.

$$\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = c$$
, where $c$ is constant and $\Delta s$, $\Delta t$ are the unit length of *Space*, *Time* what is required by the energy particle stepping forward in the dimension.


This point like particle as a fundamental building block is associated with a basic unit of energy value. It has two different capabilities which can move in the *Space* and *time* domain. The first motion is oscillating in the *Space* and the second is stepping forward without change of direction in *Space* and *Time* in an all-time-fixed discrete step size unless it interact with any other external energy particle. Although the exact mathematical expression for the trajectory that the first motion shows is unknown yet, after deep thinking what the structure of high energy is and other things, I concluded the best candidate for the model of a basic energy particle must be non-linear, non-periodic, deterministic system showing sensitive dependence on the initial conditions which was introduced in the Chaos theory. The detailed explanation why I think so will be provided in the another topic.

The most key idea in my set of assumptions is that every particle is assigned a definite unit length applied to any dimension where it lives in, here *Space* and *Time* if we set $c$ in the Space-Time law to 1. This implicit unit length is determined by total energy and mass of a particle in my theory as in [here](./energy_mass_graph.md).  



fundamental building block which is ruled by the law of space and time. It is assumed to be a point-like particle which oscillate within a bounded area in 3 dimensional space similar to the strange attractor in Chaos theory. Although the exact mathematical expression for the trajectory of a massless energy particle as known as a single photon in space and time is unknown yet, in order to understand the phenomena in the double slit experiment, I concluded that the best candidate for the mathematical expression is something like the Lorenz equation which have some unique characteristics such as sensitivity to the initial condition and no cross point in its trajectory which means non-periodic oscillation.

There are two more important characteristics kept it mind. The first is that the unit length of time for a massless particle is zero. It means the oscillation in space does not take time or the required time for completing the non-periodic oscillation in a bounded area is not infinite but zero.

> **Detailed explanation:** It may sound unbelievable to most readers but readers are advised to get used this new paradoxical concept, **completion of endless changes in no time**. To help those who feel hesitant to accept it, I think it would be desirable to begin with ontological concepts and number what ancient Greece philosophers studied. Lets consider about any irrational number such as $\pi$. We usually take it for granted that any constant number is fixed and complete in that the position of it along a real number line is well defined instantly. This complete abstract notion for any real number corresponds to a fundamental ontological category of being without engagement of space and time and is usually expressed as a symbolized form such as 1, -1.4, $\sqrt{2}$, and $\pi$.

> When we, a mortal one, need to manipulate number, for example comparing magnitude of any two numbers with no error, situation is changed dramatically. It is our strong belief that, before manipulation by operator like human or computer, any two numbers exist regardless of the existence of manipulator. Number itself also does not require any physical space and time.  This abstract notion for a number alone means simply that it is located at a single point along a real numbered line or a definite element in a set of ordered real numbers and do not produce any further outcome meaningful to other external being.

> If someone want to measure how far it is positioned from a reference, then the abstraction is of no use until it is changed into a realized form. (I used the term 'measure' here intentionally, because it is closely related with the infamous measurement problem in quantum mechanics as it will turn out in the end.) In here, the abstract form and the realized form correspond to $\pi$ and $3.14159...$. It must be noted that the realized form is needed  and thus created by an external observer who want to compare it to a reference and derived from the abstract form which , in ontological view, exists truly regardless of any external engagement.  and It is must be realized fter but it is also assumed that the whole trajectory it follows shares the same characteristic with the strange attractor introduced in Chaos theory such as no cross point in a bounded area, or no periodicity.

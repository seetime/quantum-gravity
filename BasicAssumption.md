# Basic assumptions

What I try to do here is to explain intuitively the motion of an elementary particle which can be observed in space and time dimension rather than strict mathematical formulation. It means this assumptions part is mostly based on some philosophical views which were known since ancient Greek 2500 years ago. The most two influential philosophical views that helped me a lot in studying this subject are **Parmenides's ontology** and **Pythagoras's "everything is number"**. Whenever I stuck on any weirdness in every abstracted notions such as infinity, massless and timeless which could not be easily understood, they showed me guiding principles and exit. You will see this occasionally in following discussion at the most fundamental level where nothing remains to be referred to. One more thing to note is a personal preference to simpler thing. I will choose a simpler one if there are two options producing exactly same predictions I can take. Simply, my new gravity model is better than Einstein's GR because it is simpler than it and provide much more deep insights on the most fundamental concepts such as infinity, time, energy and so on.

## Prerequisites

It is natural to think that there is no way to create something existent from nothing. So it is first belief that there must be something exist before discussing about our entire universe.

The minimal requirement for describing our universe is assumed to be the existence of three components: space, time and energy. **First two components, space and time are both background dimensions as containers where third component, i.e energy, can be located at a valid localized point within**. That is all. Nothing else is required to build our universe, at least in my model. It will be the most simplest model, isn't it?

The last sentence in bold is actually too simple to deliver what I have in mind correctly and impose too many things untold. To do so, it must be followed by detailed explanations on each of them and they are all basically assumptions or hypothesis.


## Three basic constituents of universe

1. Space
2. Time
3. Energy

## Space

The first component is the spatial dimension which is emptiness or void. It is background dimension where the third constituent, energy, can be positioned at its element, point. It has neither beginning nor end. It is just single entity which cannot be divided or separable into subsets. If we agree on Pythagorean philosophy saying everything is number, then we can think of an exact 1:1 mapping between 1 spatial dimension and real number. With such view, we can label every points of the 1 spatial dimension with numbers without missing just single one.

Space, as a single indivisible entity, is a common resource to every energy components. Empty space is absolutely necessary for the existence of energy component. It provides room where something, i.e. energy, is located at. Every separate energy components can coexist together in it. Every energy component must live with this space without exception. Space provide a method for us to distinguish two seperate point-like particles which is away from each other with non-zero distance.

So far I wrote about very boring story and reader may accept my previous description without further arguement. But it is time to introduce something weird view point. First new point of view I want to introduce is that the notion of distance which is measurement of how long two seperate positions are seperate from each other in space or length of any rigid body is emergent property to observer in the same space. Special relativity theory tells us there is a phenomena called space dialation depending on the status of observer. It is a fact but, in my new theory, it is just illusion. I would say that it is true there happens *illusory* space/time dialation but I will show in this paper that the length of rigid body A standing still in a inertial reference frame is exactly same with the length of the same rigid body B moving relative to A. Space and time dialation is only measurable to observer and not observed in the inertial reference frame of light. Be stay tuned.

It is infinitely long which means there are infinitely many points where point-like particle, i.e energy, can be located at. The most important thing to be noted is it is equally same with that comparing the size of parts of it is meaningless or it is impossible to define the size of any subset fo background dimension if there is no engagement of external measure. Its only role is just a container which provides rooms for point-like particle. Space provides spatial room and time provides temporal room to point-like particle.

 are independent with the existence of third component, energy. In other word, space does not change itself container dimensions where energy can be localized in. Energy is assumed to be a point like particle which is confined within a finite region of space and time. It means that energy does not take multiple places in space and time. Energy as a particle is assumed to take only one point along endless space. The probability distribution of a subatomic particle which is believed true in quantum mechanics is a derivable property in my new model which will be explained later.

Similar analogy about the relation between three components would be a play as a universe. In play, there are three basic components: stage as space, time as time and actor/item as energy. Actor/items can be placed on a finite region of stage. Surely actor cannot exist on multiple places. Play has a beginning and end which corresponds to time. Time plays a common role responsible for describing changes in stage and space. Time can be used to order timely the spatial change of actor or energy. So our entire universe is assumed to be completed with the infinitely many possible combinations of these thee components: space, time and energy.

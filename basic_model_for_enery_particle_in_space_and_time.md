# Basic model of energy particle in space and time

## Introduction

This document introduce the basic model of energy particle in space and time and the interaction of energy particles. I propose this model to describe the gravity at microscopic scale space which is well known as `Quantum Gravity`. Since Einstein's unsuccessful struggle for unifying gravity and electrodynamic force, many famous physicists have tried to understand the nature of gravity at the fundamental scale of space and time but in vain. It still remains unsolvable. My new model will provide a way of understanding it. As every other theory do, my model needs some basic assumptions for the existence of three basic components consisiting of our universe and more. I bet that it is the most simplestic model among that ever exist.


## Assumptions

1. Space
2. Time
3. Energy


### Prelude

Here what I am trying to do is to provide a new theory to provide a new way of understanding about object motion in space and time in all scale. To accomplish this objective, I need to change the conventional way of understanding space and time  completly from almost scratch. So before talking about basic elements in our universe, readers are advised to have a same level of understanding of me about the characteristics of a dimension.

The simplest dimension is 1 dimensional which can be thought as an infinitley long line. This line is assumed to be continous.

### 1. Space

It is assumed that `Space` is like a boundless empty container which has neither beginning nor ending. Our space has three axis.
